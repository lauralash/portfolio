        <section>
      <p> As a student at  <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I believe a beautiful website that is easy to navigate speaks
        volumns on how much the website owner cares for their users. To create a webpage that does express the care an owner has, I feel
        it takes the teamwork of like minded individuals. Nothing is more rewarding then working with fellow collegues to reach the same
        end goal and seeing the fruits of our combinded labor develope into a functional website for the world to use.
